# transfer-learning-on-fault-detection
transfer learning from lots of various measured or simulated data to single measured data

# from measured data to measured data
## 1 train three base data
## 2 tansfer to casy data
## 3 transfer to tongji data
## 4 transfer to motor data

# from simulated data to measured data
## 1 train simulated data include inner,ball,outer and normal signal data
## 2 tansfer to casy 4 fault types data and 4 outer fault data
## 3 transfer to tongji data
